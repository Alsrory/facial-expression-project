# Facial Expression Recognition

## Introduction
This project aims to recognize facial expressions using deep learning and image processing techniques. The model is based on the **"Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge"** dataset and utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to extract patterns and predict emotions from facial images.

---

## Libraries and Technologies Used
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data analysis and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and result interpretation.
- **TensorFlow, Keras**: To build and train deep learning models.
- **mlxtend**: For creating confusion matrices and analyzing results.
- **scikit-learn**: For evaluating model accuracy and generating confusion matrices.

---

## Data Preparation
- The dataset is read from a CSV file available in the Kaggle input directory.
- Pixel values are converted into **48Ã—48 grayscale image arrays**.
- Data is normalized by dividing pixel values by **255** to enhance model performance.
- Labels are converted to **categorical classes** using `to_categorical`.

## Model Development
Three different **CNN models** were developed, consisting of:
1. **Conv2D layers** for feature extraction.
2. **MaxPooling layers** for dimensionality reduction while preserving important features.
3. **Dropout layers** to prevent overfitting.
4. **Flatten layer** to transform the data into a format suitable for fully connected layers.
5. **Dense layers** for final classification into seven emotions.

The models were trained using the **Adam optimizer** with **Categorical Crossentropy** loss function. **Class weighting** was applied to balance the dataset.

## Model Evaluation
- Models were evaluated using **training and testing data**, measuring **accuracy and loss**.
- **Confusion matrices** were generated to compare predictions with actual labels.
- **Visual comparisons** between real and predicted images were created to assess model performance.

---

## Results and Conclusion
- The models achieved varying levels of accuracy across **training and test data**, reflecting generalization quality.
- **Visual comparisons** and **confusion matrices** helped identify strengths and weaknesses in classifications.
- Performance improvements can be achieved by **modifying the model architecture** or **increasing the training dataset**.
